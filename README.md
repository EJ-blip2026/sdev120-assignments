- **`/docs`** - Store all school-related documents here (e.g., notes, PDFs, assignment instructions)

## Usage

1. Place your screenshots in the `/screenshots` directory
2. Place your documents in the `/docs` directory
3. Use descriptive filenames to help organize your files (e.g., `assignment1-output.png`, `project-requirements.pdf`)
